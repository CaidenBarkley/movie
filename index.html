<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a movie with great narration and takes place in 1881. It starts out with the James Gang train robbery in Blue Cut, Missouri, where Robert is trying to get Jesse's attention. During this time Robert looks up to Jesse and is disillusioned but as the movie progresses Jesse becomes more disoriented and crazy. Robert Ford starts to look down to Jesse and scared of him and eventually takes Jesse's life for a bounty. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is kind of interesting because it is not about Jesse James, but instead it is about Robert Ford but in the title it makes him look lesser, like not as important.  </p>
